# Data Science 1: Introduction to Python for Data Science

## Engagement Expectations
This workshop is meant to be highly interactive. The instructor will lead you in two interactive teaching styles:
1. **Interactive Lecturing:** The majority of content for this workshop is in a Notebook. Though the content will be introduced via PowerPoint, the rest of the workshop will consist of walking them through the Azure Notebooks. During this time, instructors will employ an interactive lecture style, where learners will be asked to participate by asking questions and offering up ideas.
2. **Think, Pair, Share:** For some of the more complex topics, the instructor will use the "Think, Pair, Share" method. This is where you will be asked a question and given about 45 seconds to think quietly to yourself. During this time it is imperative that you are not discussing with others yet. Then, you will have an opportunity to disucss with the 1-2 people next to you. Make sure you don't just share your answer, but *why* you think that is the answer. Finally, the isntructor will ask for a few people to share what they discussed with their neighbors. 

*Notice*: Various interactive cues are called out in the Notebooks. These are suggestions and at the instructor's discression.

## Content
The primary source of content will be relatively bare Azure Notebooks where the instructor will guide you through discovering the different features of Python, NumPy, Pandas, and general data cleaning and manipulation. There is also a folder called "Reference Material" which has all of the same content in the primary notebooks, plus written explanations and additional features not covered in this workshop.

## Tips and Tricks
Azure Notebooks is still in Preview. This means that there are some times when it will fail. Here are some tips for avoiding losing your work:
- Ensure their work is being saved. In the Jupyter Notebook there is always one of two messages to the right of the title of the notebook: `(autosaved)` or `(unsaved changes)`. Make sure you're noticing that your work is being saved. You should consider checking every 10 minutes or so. 
- Sometimes Notebooks get into a state where the Kernel cannot be started. Sometimes re-starting the kernel will work. But often you will have to somepletely sign out of Azure Notebooks and then sign back in.
