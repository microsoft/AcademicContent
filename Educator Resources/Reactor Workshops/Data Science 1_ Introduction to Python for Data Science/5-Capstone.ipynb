Earlier in this section we discussed using methods such as `DataFrame.info`, `DataFrame.head`, and `DataFrame.tail` to examine some aspects of a `DataFrame`. While these methods are critical, they are on their own often insufficient to get enough information to know how to approach a new dataset. This is where exploratory statistics and visualizations for datasets come in.\n\nTo see what we mean in terms of gaining exploratory insight (both visually and numerically), let's dig into one of the the datasets that come with the scikit-learn library, the Boston Housing Dataset (though you will load it from a CSV file):"

The story is more ambiguous for communities dominated by older houses: proximity to the Charles significantly increases home prices in one community (and that one presumably farther away from the city); for all others, being situated on the river either provided a modest increase in value or actually decreased mean home prices.\n\nWhile groupings like this can be a great way to begin to interrogate your data, you might not care for the 'tall' format it comes in.
