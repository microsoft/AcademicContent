Typical actions include removing duplicate rows, removing rows or columns with missing values or algorithmically replacing the missing values, normalizing data, and selecting feature columns. A machine-learning model is only as good as the data it is trained with. Preparing the data is arguably the most crucial step in the machine-learning process.\n\nBefore you can prepare a dataset, you need to understand its content and structure. In the previous steps, you imported a dataset containing on-time arrival information for a major U.S. airline. That data included 26 columns and thousands of rows, with each row representing one flight and containing information such as the flight's origin, destination, and scheduled departure time. You also loaded the data into the Jupyter notebook and used a simple Python script to create a pandas DataFrame from it.\n\nTo get a count of rows, run the following code:"

The goal of that model is to predict whether a flight you are considering booking is likely to arrive on time. If you know that the flight is likely to be late, you might choose to book another flight.\n\nThe next step, therefore, is to filter the dataset to eliminate columns that aren't relevant to a predictive model. For example, the aircraft's tail number probably has little bearing on whether a flight will arrive on time, and at the time you book a ticket, you have no way of knowing whether a flight will be cancelled, diverted, or delayed. By contrast, the scheduled departure time could have a lot to do with on-time arrivals. Because of the hub-and-spoke system used by most airlines, morning flights tend to be on time more often than afternoon or evening flights. And at some major airports, traffic stacks up during the day, increasing the likelihood that later flights will be delayed.\n\nPandas provides an easy way to filter out columns you don't want.

The granularity of the numbers in this column — it contains more than 500 unique values — could have a negative impact on accuracy in a machine-learning model. This can be resolved using a technique called binning or quantization. What if you divided each number in this column by 100 and rounded down to the nearest integer? 1030 would become 10, 1925 would become 19, and so on, and you would be left with a maximum of 24 discrete values in this column. Intuitively, it makes sense, because it probably doesn't matter much whether a flight leaves at 10:30 a.m. or 10:40 a.m. It matters a great deal whether it leaves at 10:30 a.m. or 5:30 p.m.\n\nIn addition, the dataset's ORIGIN and DEST columns contain airport codes that represent categorical machine-learning values. These columns need to be converted into discrete columns containing indicator variables, sometimes known as \"dummy\" variables. In other words, the ORIGIN column, which contains five airport codes, needs to be converted into five columns, one per airport, with each column containing 1s and 0s indicating whether a flight originated at the airport that the column represents. The DEST column needs to be handled in a similar manner.\n\nIn this portion of the exercise, you will \"bin\" the departure times in the CRS_DEP_TIME column and use pandas' get_dummies method to create indicator columns from the ORIGIN and DEST columns.\n\nUse the following code to bin the departure times:"

It has built-in support for popular regression, classification, and clustering algorithms and works with other Python libraries such as NumPy and SciPy. With Sckit-learn, a simple method call can replace hundreds of lines of hand-written code. Sckit-learn allows you to focus on building, training, tuning, and testing machine-learning models without getting bogged down coding algorithms.\n\nIn this lab, the third of four in a series, you will use Sckit-learn to build a machine-learning model utilizing on-time arrival data for a major U.S. airline. The goal is to create a model that might be useful in the real world for predicting whether a flight is likely to arrive on time. It is precisely the kind of problem that machine learning is commonly used to solve. And it's a great way to increase your machine-learning chops while getting acquainted with Scikit-learn."

One of the best overall measures for a binary classification model is Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (sometimes referred to as \"ROC AUC\"), which essentially quantifies how often the model will make a correct prediction regardless of the outcome. In this exercise, you will compute an ROC AUC score for the model you built in the previous exercise and learn about some of the reasons why that score is lower than the mean accuracy output by the score method. You will also learn about other ways to gauge the accuracy of the model.\n\nBefore you compute the ROC AUC, you must generate prediction probabilities for the test set. These probabilities are estimates for each of the classes, or answers, the model can predict. For example, [0.88199435, 0.11800565] means that there's an 89% chance that a flight will arrive on time (ARR_DEL15 = 0) and a 12% chance that it won't (ARR_DEL15 = 1).

This score is skewed by the fact that the dataset the model was trained and tested with contains many more rows representing on-time arrivals than rows representing late arrivals. Because of this imbalance in the data, you are more likely to be correct if you predict that a flight will be on time than if you predict that a flight will be late.\n\nROC AUC takes this into account and provides a more accurate indication of how likely it is that a prediction of on-time or late will be correct."

This is important, because if a binary classification model trained to recognize cats and dogs is tested with a dataset that is 95% dogs, it could score 95% simply by guessing \"dog\" every time.
