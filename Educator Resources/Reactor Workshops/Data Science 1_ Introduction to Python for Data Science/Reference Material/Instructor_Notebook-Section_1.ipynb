This notebook is designed to accompany the Microsoft Reactors introduction to data science workshop, and it will use Python as the primary means of illustrating data-science tools and resources.\n\nSeveral examples in this notebook draw from the [python.org introductory tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/introduction.html) and examples given in the [Python 3 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) (with edits and amendments). This introduction to Python is written for Python 3.6.7 but is generally applicable to other Python 3.x versions. \n\nOriginal material from python.org is Copyright (c) 2001-2019 Python Software Foundation.\n\nThis course makes extensive use of Jupyter Notebooks hosted on Microsoft Azure. Azure-hosted Jupyter Notebooks provide an easy way for you to experiment with programming concepts in an interactive fashion that requires no installation of software by students on local computers.\n\nJupyter Notebooks are divided into cells. Each cell contains either text written in the Markdown markup language or a space in which to write and execute computer code. Because all the code resides inside code cells, you can run each code cell inline rather than using a separate Python interactive window.\n\n> **Note**: This notebook is designed to have you run code cells one by one, and several code cells contain deliberate errors for demonstration purposes. As a result, if you use the **Cell** > **Run All** command, some code cells past the error won't be run. To resume running the code in each case, use **Cell** > **Run All Below** from the cell after the error."

A comment may appear at the start of a line or following white space or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Because comments are there to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples. For example:"

You can see this by using the Python interpreter as a simple calculator: type an expression, and you can see the output immediately.\n\nHow can you see the results? The Python interpreter runs inside this notebook. To run the code inside a cell, either click the **Run Cell** button at the top of the window or press **Ctrl**+**Enter**.

Similarly, you might also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.\n\nTo support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a [*module*](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html). Definitions from a module can be imported into other programs or modules.\n\nFor example, the `factorial()` function is not one of the standard functions built into Python. It is part of the Python [`math`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) module. So, when we run `factorial()` before importing `math`, we get an error:"
