ML and the branch of computer science in which it resides, artificial intelligence (AI), are so central to data science that ML/AI and data science are synonymous in the minds of many people. However, the preceding sections have hopefully demonstrated that there are a lot of other facets to the discipline of data science apart from the prediction and classification tasks that supply so much value to the world. (Remember, at least 80 percent of the effort in most data-science projects will be composed of cleaning and manipulating the data to prepare it for analysis.)\n\nThat said, ML is fun! In this section, and the next one on data science in the cloud, you will get to play around with some of the “magic” of data science and start to put into practice the tools you have spent the last five sections learning. Let's get started!\n\n## A quick aside: types of ML\n\nAs you get deeper into data science, it might seem like there are a bewildering array of ML algorithms out there. However many you encounter, it can be handy to remember that most ML algorithms fall into three broad categories:\n - **Predictive algorithms**: These analyze current and historical facts to make predictions about unknown events, such as the future or customers’ choices.\n - **Classification algorithms**: These teach a program from a body of data, and the program then uses that learning to classify new observations.\n - **Time-series forecasting algorithms**: While it can argued that these algorithms are a part of predictive algorithms, their techniques are specialized enough that they in many ways functions like a separate category. Time-series forecasting is beyond the scope of this course, but we have more than enough work with focusing here on prediction and classification.\n\n## Prediction: linear regression\n\n> **Learning goal:** By the end of this subsection, you should be comfortable fitting linear regression models, and you should have some familiarity with interpreting their output.\n\nArguably the simplest form of machine learning is to draw a line connecting two points and make predictions about where that trend might lead.\n\nBut what if you have more than two points—and those points don't line up neatly? What if you have points in more than two dimensions? This is where linear regression comes in.\n\nFormally, linear regression is used to predict a quantitative *response* (the values on a Y axis) that is dependent on one or more *predictors* (values on one or more axes that are orthogonal to Y, commonly just thought of collectively as X). The working assumption is that the relationship between predictors and response is more or less linear. The goal of linear regression is to fit a straight line in the best possible way to minimize the deviation between our observed responses in the dataset and the responses predicted by our line, the linear approximation. (The most common means of assessing this error is called the **least squares method**; it consists of minimizing the number you get when you square the difference between your predicted value and the actual value and add up all of those squared differences for your entire dataset.)\n\n<img align=\"left\" style=\"padding-right:10px;\" src=\"../Images/linear_regression.png\">\n"

We commonly refer to $B_0$ and $B_1$ as coefficients and to $E$ as the *error term*, which represents the margin of error in the model.\n\nLet's try this in practice with actual data. (Note: no graph paper will be harmed in the course of these predictions.)\n\n### Data exploration\n\nWe'll begin by importing our usual libraries and using our %matplotlib inline magic command:"

Such a model is termed *overfitted*.\n\nTo avoid this, data scientists divide their datasets for ML into *training* data (the data used to fit the model) and *test* data (data used to evaluate how accurate the model is). Fortunately, scikit-learn provides a function that enables us to easily divide up our data between training and test sets: `train_test_split`. In this case, we will use 70 percent of our data for training and reserve 30 percent of it for testing. (Note that you will also supply a fourth parameter to the function: `random_state`; `train_test_split` randomly divides up our data between test and training, so this number provides an explicit seed for the random-number generator so that you will get the same result each time you run this code snippet.)"

If our simple analogy of predictive analytics was drawing a line through points and extrapolating from that, then classification can be described in its simplest form as drawing lines around groups of points.\n\nWhile linear regression is used to predict quantitative responses, *logistic* regression is used for classification problems. Formally, logistic regression predicts the categorical response (Y) based on predictors (Xs). Logistic regression goes by several names, and it is also known in the scholarly literature as logit regression, maximum-entropy classification (MaxEnt), and the log-linear classifier. In this algorithm, the probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single trial are modeled using a sigmoid (S-curve) function. Sigmoid functions take any value and transform it to be between 0 and 1, which can be used as a probability for a class to be predicted, with the goal of predictors mapping to 1 when something belongs in the class and 0 when they do not.\n\n<img align=\"left\" style=\"padding-right:10px;\" src=\"../Images/logistic_regression.png?\">"
