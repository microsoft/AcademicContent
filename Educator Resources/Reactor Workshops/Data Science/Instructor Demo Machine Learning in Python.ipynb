Jupyter is an environment based on IPython that facilitates interactive programming and data analysis using Python and other programming languages. Azure Notebooks provide Jupyter as a service for free. It's a convenient way to write Python code without having to install and manage a Jupyter server. And it's completely Web-based, making it an ideal solution for collaborating online.\n\nIn this lab, the first of four in a series, you will create an Azure notebook, import a dataset containing on-time arrival information for a major U.S. airline, and load the dataset into the notebook.

Typical actions include removing duplicate rows, removing rows or columns with missing values or algorithmically replacing the missing values, normalizing data, and selecting feature columns. A machine-learning model is only as good as the data it is trained with. Preparing the data is arguably the most crucial step in the machine-learning process.\n\nIn this lab, the second of four in a series, you will use the Jupyter notebook you created in the previous lab to wrangle the dataset that you imported. You will use the Python Data Analysis Library (Pandas) to do the bulk of the work in transforming the data. The goal is to get the dataset ready to use in a machine-learning model, and to get first-hand experience with Pandas\n\nBefore you can prepare a dataset, you need to understand its content and structure. In the previous steps, you imported a dataset containing on-time arrival information for a major U.S. airline. That data included 26 columns and thousands of rows, with each row representing one flight and containing information such as the flight's origin, destination, and scheduled departure time. You also loaded the data into the Jupyter notebook and used a simple Python script to create a Pandas DataFrame from it.\n\nA DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure. The columns in a DataFrame can be of different types, just like columns in a spreadsheet or database table. It is the most commonly used object in Pandas. In this exercise, you will examine the DataFrame — and the data inside it — more closely.\n\nThe code that you added to the notebook in the previous lab creates a DataFrame from flightdata.csv and calls DataFrame.head on it to display the first five rows. One of the first things you typically want to know about a dataset is how many rows it contains. \n\nTo get a count of rows, run the following code:"

By contrast, the scheduled departure time could have a lot to do with on-time arrivals.
