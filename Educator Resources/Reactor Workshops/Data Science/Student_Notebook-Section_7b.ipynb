    "Just as you created a web service that could consume data and return predictions, so there are many AI software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings on the web that will return predictions or classifications based on data you supply to them. One family of these is Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using cloud-based services is that they provide cutting-edge models that you can access without having to train them. This can help accelerate both your exploration and use of ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure provides Cognitive Services APIs that can be consumed using Python to conduct image recognition, speech recognition, and text recognition, just to name a few. For the purposes of this notebook, we're going to look at using the Computer Vision API and the Text Analytics API.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we’ll start by obtaining a Cognitive Services API key. Note that you can get a free key for seven days, and then you'll be required to pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about pricing for Cognitive Services, see https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/\n",
    "\n",
    "Browse to **Try Azure Cognitive Services** at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select **Vision API**.\n",
    "2. Select **Computer Vision**.\n",
    "3. Click **Get API key**.\n",
    "4. If prompted for credentials, select **Free 7-day trial**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the above steps to also retrieve a Text Analytics API key from the Language APIs category. (You can also do this by scrolling down on the page with your API keys and clicking **Add** under the appropriate service.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your API keys in hand, you're ready to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Learning goal:** By the end of this part, you should have a basic comfort with accessing cloud-based cognitive services by API from a Python environment."
