    "Having explored NumPy in Section 4, it is time to get to know the other workhorse of data science in Python: pandas. The pandas library in Python really does a lot to make working with data--and importing, cleaning, and organizing it--so much easier that it is hard to imagine doing data science in Python without it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it was not always this way. Wes McKinney developed the library out of necessity in 2008 while at AQR Capital Management in order to have a better tool for dealing with data analysis. The library has since taken off as an open-source software project that has become a mature and integral part of the data science ecosystem. (In fact, some examples in this section will be drawn from McKinney's book, *Python for Data Analysis*.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The name 'pandas' actually has nothing to do with Chinese bears but rather comes from the term *panel data*, a form of multi-dimensional data involving measurements over time that comes out the econometrics and statistics community. Ironically, while panel data is a usable data structure in pandas, it is not generally used today and we will not examine it in this course. Instead, we will focus on the two most widely used data structures in pandas: `Series` and `DataFrame`s."

Another aspect of pandas that makes it a compelling tool for many data scientists is pandas' capability to perform efficient element-wise operations on data. pandas builds on ufuncs from NumPy to supply theses capabilities and then extends them to provide additional power for data manipulation:\n",
    " - For unary operations (such as negation and trigonometric functions), ufuncs in pandas **preserve index and column labels** in the output.\n",
