    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Since its first release in 1991, Python has risen to become not just a popular general-purpose programming language, but a preeminent computer language for data science. This manual is designed to accompany the Microsoft Reactors introduction to data science course, and it will use Python as the primary means of illustrating data- science tools and resources in the cloud. For students unfamiliar with Python (or programming more generally), this course also includes a quick introduction to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several examples in this notebook draw from the [python.org introductory tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/introduction.html) and examples given in the [Python 3 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) (with edits and amendments). This introduction to Python is written for Python 3.6.7 but is generally applicable to other Python 3.x versions. \n",

    "Jupyter notebooks are divided into cells. Each cell either contains text written in the Markdown markup language or a space in which to write and execute computer code. Because all the code resides inside code cells, you can run each code cell inline rather than using a separate Python interactive window.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: This notebook is designed to have you run code cells one by one, and several code cells contain deliberate errors for demonstration purposes. As a result, if you use the **Cell** > **Run All** command, some code cells past the error won't be run. To resume running the code in each case, use **Cell** > **Run All Below** from the cell after the error."

A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character.
