# Azure Services

This folder contains hands-on labs introducing some of the essential services that Azure provides to application developers. Learn how to deploy serverless code that runs in the cloud using [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/), run Docker containers in the cloud using the [Azure Container Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-service/), use Azure to build sophisticated [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) networks, and more.
