# Deep Learning

This folder contains several series of hands-on labs designed to introduce tools and libraries for building intelligent apps that leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Each subfolder contains one series of hands-on labs and has a number in the name (200, 300, or 400) that represents the level of technical detail in the series, with 400 being the most advanced. Each series consists of four hands-on labs that build on one another and follow this pattern:

- Ingest - Gather data
- Process - Prepare or clean the data for use in machine learning
- Predict - Train and score a machine-learning model
- Visualize - Visualize the output from the model

To work a series of labs, start with the first lab in the series, then proceed to the second, the third, and the fourth, in that order. Depending on the technical level, a series generally requires 1 to 2 hours to work from start to finish.

Lab Series | Scenario | Technology/Language | Cost
