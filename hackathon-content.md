## [Use ML to classify Yoga Poses](https://github.com/cassieview/Use-ML-To-Classify-Yoga-Poses)

This tutorial will go over how to use Azure Cognitive Services to get an image dataset and train a Custom Vision model. The repository has a simple nodejs console app that uses Bing Image Search to scrape images to a local directory based on search term(s). Then use the images scraped to create a Custom Vision model with Azure Cognitive Services.

## [How to win a hackathon with Azure](https://youtu.be/gnieqi89Ejw)

Winning a hackathon requires focus on creating working prototype of your project very fast. Azure Platform Services can help you to achieve that, providing easy to use building blocks that can be put together quickly. During this talk, I demonstrate the use of three most useful services for hackathon scenarios: bot framework, cognitive services and azure functions. During the demo, I create a bot that is trained to recognize photographs of Triumphal Arches in different cities.

## [Cognitive Services and Science Art](https://youtu.be/gpQwzu0tyQM)

Microsoft Cognitive Services are pre-trained AI models for things related to computer vision, text analytics, speech and more. They can be used as REST services from the cloud, or on the edge. While there are many business uses of Cognitive Services, in this talk we focus on rather unusual direction – Science Art, and creating Cognitive Portraits from photographs using Face API, affine transformations and a bit of creativity.
