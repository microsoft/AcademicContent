# Deep Learning

This folder contains several series of hands-on labs designed to introduce tools and libraries for building intelligent apps that leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Some of the tools and libraries that are covered include:

- The [Microsoft Data Science VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview)
- The [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/cognitive-toolkit/)
- [Azure Machine Learning Workbench](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/quickstart-installation)
- The [Microsoft Machine Learning Library for Apache Spark](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2017/06/07/announcing-microsoft-machine-learning-library-for-apache-spark/) (MMLSpark)
- [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/)
- [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

Each subfolder contains one series of hands-on labs and has a number in the name (200, 300, or 400) that represents the level of technical detail in the series, with 400 being the most advanced. Each series consists of four hands-on labs that build on top of one another and follow this pattern:

- Ingest - Gather data
- Process - Prepare or clean the data for use in machine learning
- Predict - Train and score a machine-learning model
- Visualize - Visualize the output from the model

To work a series of labs, start with the first lab in the series, then proceed to the second, the third, and the fourth, in that order. Depending on the technical level, a series generally requires 1 to 2 hours to work from start to finish.

Data science is the new frontier in software development. Use these labs to expand your knowledge of AI, machine learning, and deep learning with neural networks, and acquire first-hand experience with some of the tools of the trade.
