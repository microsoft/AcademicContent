### Objectives ###

These labs are designed to help you get started building with hardware and Azure IOT Suite 

# Adafruit Feather Azure IOT Suite

The aim of this mini project is for the Adafruit Feather to communicate with to the Microsoft Azure IoT Hub. Adafruit Feather should be able to send telemetry messages and also respond to commands sent to it by the IoT hub. The Adafruit Feather component used in this project is from the Microsoft Azure IoT Starter Kits 

# Get Started with Microsoft Azure IoT Starter Kit - Adafruit Feather M0 WiFi (Arduino-compatible)
This tutorial describes the process of taking your Feather M0 WiFi kit, and using it to develop a temperature, humidity and pressure reader that can communicate with the cloud using the  Microsoft Azure IoT SDK.
