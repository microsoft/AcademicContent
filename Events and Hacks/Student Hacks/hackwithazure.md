## What is Azure?
Azure is a cloud computing platform (similar to AWS and Google Cloud Platform). We offer a broad range of services for developers to create with. 

In particular, Azure has great, beginner-friendly services to help you use...
- [AI/Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/ai-platform/)
- [Virtual Machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/)
- [Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/)
- [Containers (Docker/Kubernetes)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/)
- [Bots](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

...in your hacks! 

[Check the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/#pivot=get-started&panel=get-started1) on how to get started with Azure. We offer a full range of labs with [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/).
