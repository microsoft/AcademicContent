            This repo provides technical resources for faculty, students, and Microsoft developer advocates for use in computer science learning. The modules cover common cross-platform scenarios including mobile app dev, web dev, internet of things, data science, machine learning, and devops. Content delivery is divided into four groups: Instructor-led, Problem Sets, Tech Talks, and Workshops. 
            <p>Most hands-on learning focuses on cross-platform technology deployment on the Microsoft Azure although most concepts can be applied to any cloud platform solution. Academic users can get free Azure from various programs like
